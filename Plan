-Clicker Game
-Train to do missions
-More missions require more training points

Plan for auto clicker
Create auto level that adds all purchases similar to training dummy. Have a function set to true while the auto level is > 0 that uses setInterval() (setInterval(function, milliseconds, param1, param2, ...)) to run train every so often. 
POSSIBLE CONFLICT
If you call train from the training button and the auto function calls it at the same time possible confusion? probably nothing though.
